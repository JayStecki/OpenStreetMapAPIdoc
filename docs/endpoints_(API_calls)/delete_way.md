Deletes an existing way element.

!!! warning "To delete existing way, **first** you must operate inside [open changeset](open_changeset.md)."
    Insert the ongoing ==changeset ID== to the `request body`. After completing various operations on the element, you should [close a changset](close_changeset.md) (or it will [close automatically](../general_informations/changesets.md#changesets-attributes)). You can also do multiple operations on many elements (create, update, delete) in one ongoing changeset.

In `request body` the ==way ID== and ==version== are also required (check the example).<!--to samo, co w poprzednich: rozdziel "way" i "id", bo nie tak nazywa siÄ™ atrybut-->

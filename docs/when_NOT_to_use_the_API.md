!!! danger "For bulk upload scripts or data modification, the direct API use may not be the proper mechanism."
    The modern version of creating a bulk upload or modification script is to build a changeset, load it into an editor like JOSM, and verify the work prior to commit.
     
You can also use the API to upload a [changeset](general_informations/changesets.md) in an atomic manner.

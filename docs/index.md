# Welcome to OpenStreetMap API doc

Hello and welcome! OpenStreetMap is one of the the most widely used background mapping service in the world. It is open source software, co-created by a worldwide community.

!!! warning "This isn't an official OpenStreetMap API documentation."
    Existing OSM API documentation is available [^^here^^](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API){:target="_blank"}.

!!! success "This documentation is **demonstrative only** and its scope is limited."
    The documentation is merely a proposal for migration of existing open source API ([^^OSM v0.6^^](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6){:target="_blank"}) to a modern and usable layout. This documentation **contains only 20 endpoints** (API calls) of basic usability.

Keep calm and have fun exploring it :smirk:.

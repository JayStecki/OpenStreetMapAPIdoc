At the time of first deployment, semantic versioning (with a minor version number) wasn't an established concept. As a result, **the API doesn't follow this scheme**. Since many applications wouldn't be able to handle minor version number changes correctly, no attempt is made to add it. However, the current version can be thought of as 0.6.9.

At the time of first deployment, semantic versioning (with a minor version number) wasn't an established concept. As a result, the API doesn't follow this scheme. Many applications wouldn't be able to handle minor version number changes correctly, thus no attempt is made to add it, although the current version can be thought of as being 0.6.9.
